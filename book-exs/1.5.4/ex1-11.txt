How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?

A: I would use numbers, non-alphanumeric characters, blank input, special symbols like emojis, long strings, a mix of escape sequences, strings containing ponctuation, multiple blanks, etc.
